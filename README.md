# Express.js Middleware Bug: Unexpected Response Blocking Subsequent Middleware

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Express.js middleware handling that can be difficult to identify. The bug arises from a middleware function prematurely sending a response, thereby blocking the execution of subsequent middleware functions and route handlers.

## Bug Description

A middleware function inappropriately sends a response before passing control to the next middleware or the route handler.  This prevents subsequent middleware from executing and causes routes to behave unexpectedly. The response will be returned to the client before other handlers are executed.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
3. Run `node bug.js`.
4. Access `/another` in your browser.  The expected response is 'Another route', but instead you will receive 'Middleware 2 intercepted'.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that middleware functions only send a response when absolutely necessary.  If further processing is needed, it must call `next()` to pass control to the next middleware function in the chain.

## Solution Code

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the middleware. The key change is removing the `res.send()` call in the middleware that was causing the issue. Now subsequent middleware and routes will run as expected.
